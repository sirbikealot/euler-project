2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

# Start with n = 20
# While loop with n +=20 counter
# Use divmod or % operator.  Object should be variable (i) that loops or iterates from 2 to 19 (1 is trivial since we're working with integers. So is 20 because we're incrementing by 20.)
# Exit (or 'break' or 'return') and print number when number % i for all cases.  Would be great if built into until statement that initiates loop. Then loop would exit and print number would be command after end keyword of loop.
